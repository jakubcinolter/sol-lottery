# Lottery Smart Contract

This is a simple lottery smart contract implemented in Solidity. Players can send 0.1 ETH to the contract and participate in the lottery. When the lottery reaches 11 players, a winner is randomly selected and receives half of the prize pool. The other half of the prize pool goes to the contract owner.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity ide
- Truffle

## How to Use
  
To participate in the lottery, send 0.1 ETH to the contract address using your Ethereum wallet. You can do this using tools like Metamask or directly from an exchange that supports Ethereum transactions.

Once the lottery has reached 20 players, a winner will be randomly selected and receive half of the prize pool. The other half of the prize pool goes to the contract owner.

You can also check the contract balance and the number of players by calling the balance and numPlayers functions, respectively.
